      <h3><strong>NO WARRANTIES:</strong></h3>
      <p>To the maximum extent permitted by law, the Product as well as Limited Support, Maintenance and all other services provided by Bitration or its licensors are provided 'as is' and 'with all faults' without warranty of any kind, either express, implied or statutory, and Bitration and its licensors disclaim all such warranties, including but not limited to implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-interference, accuracy of data, accuracy of informational content, system integration, title and non-infringement, with regard to the Product and/or the provision of or failure to provide Limited Support or Maintenance. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of implied warranties, so the above exclusion may not apply to Licensee.</p>

      <h3><strong>LIMITATION OF LIABILITY:</strong></h3>
      <p>In the event the exclusion of implied warranties does not apply and in the event of a breach of such warranties, Bitration' and its suppliers' entire liability and its exclusive remedy will be, at Bitration' option, either: (a) return of the price paid, if any; or (b) repair or replacement of the Product returned to Bitration with a receipt. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, in no event will Bitration or its suppliers be liable (whether under contract, tort, strict liability or otherwise) for any special, incidental, indirect, or consequential damages (including, without limitation, loss inaccuracy or corruption of data, loss of opportunity, loss of privacy, cost of recovery, cost of procurement or substitute goods or services, system downtime, failure of security mechanisms, financial loss, loss of goodwill, revenue or loss of profit, business interruption, loss of business information, or any other pecuniary or business loss for any reason whatsoever) arising out of the use of or inability to use the Product, including beta versions thereof, as well as Maintenance, Limited Support and all other services provided by Bitration or the provision of or failure to provide Limited Support or Maintenance, even if Bitration has been advised of the possibility of such damages. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, in no event will the aggregate and cumulative liability (whether under contract, tort, strict liability or otherwise) of Bitration and its affiliates and their respective licensors and other suppliers for any matters arising under this agreement or otherwise exceed the lesser of the amount paid by Licensee to Bitration or its affiliates, as applicable, in connection with the particular transaction giving rise to the claim and USD$1000. As some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of liability, the above limitation may not apply in certain jurisdictions.</p>

      <p>Licensee agrees that the limitations of this section and the section headed 'No Warranties' above are essential and that Licensee would not be permitted to use the Product absent the terms of such sections.
